It also describes how to connect the components to specific platforms for example Angular.  

### Notes

- It will take some time to get into Figma & Zeplin. 
Be patient. The links inserted here were enough for me 
to go through the complete design and hand over process up to 
the coding of components.
- Name your components self-explanatory and with a structure (_Button/Loading/Large_)
- The code preview of the components in Zeplin is not available 
for all kind of projects. It will say "No description or code snippet." The connection, however, exists.
